- ✅ Documented all configuration options

#### 1.2 Firebase Integration ✅
- ✅ Built utilities to sync Python config schema to Firebase
- ✅ Support both global and project-specific configurations
- ✅ Maintained existing Firebase collection structure

#### 1.3 Frontend Configuration Interface ✅
- ✅ Created expandable settings tab in frontend
- ✅ Exposed full raw config editing (with breaking change warnings)
- ✅ Implemented direct Firebase read/write (bypass Python for frontend)
- ✅ Added validation and error handling for config changes
- ✅ Used Python backend as source of truth for business logic

### 2. Lead Finding Implementation ✅
**Goal**: Identify leads based on user input to projects using Apollo API

#### 2.1 Location Processing ✅
- ✅ **2.1a**: Parse typed location using LLMs to Apollo format
- ✅ **2.1b**: Add location config option when creating projects
- ✅ **Decision made**: Implemented both LLM parsing and user config approach

#### 2.2 Job Role Configuration ✅
- ✅ Set reasonable target positions (CEO, CTO, Founder, etc.)
- ✅ Made job roles configurable at project and global level
- ✅ Implemented with hardcoded list initially, exposed to user

#### 2.3 Lead Filtering Logic ✅
- ✅ Filter to one person per company (configurable)
- ✅ Remove leads without email addresses
- ✅ Implemented duplicate detection and removal

### 3. Lead Enrichment (Perplexity Integration) ✅
**Goal**: Enhance leads with additional research data

- ✅ Added enrichment prompt configuration (hardcode initially)
- ✅ Implemented Perplexity API calls for company/person research
- ✅ Attached enrichment results as string to lead records
- ✅ Handled enrichment errors gracefully

### 4. Email Generation (OpenAI Integration) ✅
**Goal**: Generate personalized outreach emails

- ✅ Added email generation prompts (outreach + followup)
- ✅ Implemented OpenAI API calls for personalized emails
- ✅ Support different email types (initial outreach, followups)
- ✅ Generate subject lines and email content

### 5. Email Sending & Scheduling ✅
**Goal**: Deliver emails and manage follow-up sequences

- ✅ Integrated SMTP server configuration and sending
- ✅ Implemented email scheduling system
- ✅ Added followup email automation with delays
- ✅ Respected daily email limits and rate limiting

### 6. Configuration Management ✅
**Goal**: Comprehensive configuration management system

- ✅ Global configuration management (get/update)
- ✅ Project-specific configuration management (get/update)
- ✅ Configuration inheritance and override system
- ✅ Firebase Functions for configuration CRUD operations

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Configuration System
- **Single Source of Truth**: Python dataclasses define all configuration schemas
- **Firebase Sync**: Bidirectional sync maintains existing Firebase structure
- **Inheritance**: Project configs inherit from global with selective overrides
- **Type Safety**: Full Python typing with validation

### Lead Processing Pipeline
1. **Apollo Search** → Configuration-driven search parameters
2. **Comprehensive Filtering** → Duplicates, blacklist, quality filters
3. **Batch Saving** → Efficient Firestore batch operations
4. **Optional Enrichment** → Perplexity integration with retry logic
5. **Email Generation** → OpenAI-powered personalization
6. **Scheduled Sending** → SMTP with rate limiting and scheduling

### API Integration
- **Apollo.io**: Lead discovery with location and role targeting
- **Perplexity**: Company and person research for enrichment
- **OpenAI**: Personalized email content generation
- **SMTP**: Email delivery with professional formatting
