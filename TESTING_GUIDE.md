- All lead fields are included
- CSV format is properly quoted
- Data matches what's displayed in table

### 6. ‚úÖ Project-Scoped Operations
**Test across multiple projects**:

**Test Steps**:
1. Create 2-3 different projects
2. Add leads to each project
3. Switch between projects
4. Verify leads are project-specific
5. Test blacklisting in one project doesn't affect others

**Expected Results**:
- Leads are isolated per project
- Project switching works smoothly
- Lead counts update correctly
- Project-specific blacklisting works

### 7. ‚úÖ Navigation & UX Testing
**Test overall user experience**:

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate through all tabs
2. Test project selection flow (should auto-switch to leads)
3. Verify loading states appear during operations
4. Test error handling with invalid data
5. Check toast notifications for all actions

**Expected Results**:
- Smooth navigation between sections
- Automatic tab switching works
- Loading states provide feedback
- Error messages are helpful
- Success notifications confirm actions

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Issues
- **"Unexpected end of JSON input"**: Firebase config issue, use development mode
- **TypeScript errors**: All should be resolved in current implementation
